# SCOPE data service

Data service for RDF-based BIM representation including geometry.


## Description

The SCOPE data service consists of:
- Web service with Fuseki database
- Plugin for Autodesk Revit 2019 to export geometric and semantic information to Fuseki
- GUI for geometry visualization and SPARQL queries

Developed within:  SCOPE (www.projekt-scope.de)<br/>
SCOPE is a German research project funded by the BMWi (Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Energie).

The SCOPE data service allows to create, store and visualize complex geometrical information with the help of the open-source geometry kernel openCASCADE. It consists of an Autodesk Revit 2019 exporter based on RevitPythonShell and a GUI for visualizing the 3D geometry and its RDF graph representation.

The RDF representation in Fuseki mainly uses the ontologies w3id.org/bot, w3id.org/bpo and w3id.org/occ.

## Installation

Docker and Make are required. In the base folder and with a running docker engine, start the services with "make up".

### Test run with python3:

Call "python serverTest.py" in ./services/client. The script creates some geometry in the Fuseki TDB which can be visualized at localhost:22634 after a couple of seconds.

### Test run with Autodesk Revit 2019 / RevitPythonShell:

Copy the script sendRevitdatatoTDB.py in ./services/client to RevitPythonShell and run it. The script exports some basic Revit families. Revit example files can be found in the same folder. Visualizing at localhost:22634 might take some minutes, we are currently working on improving the speed.
